AptBrowse is a web app designed for comparing apartments within a specific zipcode. Built from the ground up using MVC
principles, AptBrowse queries the Google Places API with a user-inputted zipcode and returns results via a simple form
view. This view enables the user to easily compare apartment offerings within an area. The "admin" mode is currently
in development, which allows the user to directly interact with a mySQL database and save search results there.

Current Most Functional Version: mvc_app/home.html

Version in Development: jquery_app_latest/home.html

Current Objectives: 
* Migration of all functionality from previous version (mvc_app)
* Complete refactoring of code to be more consistent with MVC principles
* Implementation of jQuery where appropriate
* Transition to a Node backend
